# The Lazy Script
A small project which helps to make me lazier while enjoying my food with short form content. Basically, I use the [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and [pyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries together to **fake a scroll**.

I use my head and perform a **nod**, this nod is transformed into a scroll.
# How to install the project dependencies ?
Open up a terminal or a command prompt and navigate to the directory of your Python project. Once you are there, type the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the required dependencies for the project :)
